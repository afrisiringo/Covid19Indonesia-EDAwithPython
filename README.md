This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on COVID-19 cases across different provinces in Indonesia. The analysis covers the time range from March 2020 to September 2022, providing insights into the pandemic's progression throughout the country. 

## Usage

- The dataset used in this analysis can be accessed in `covid_19_indonesia_time_series_all.csv`
- The EDA script is available in `Covid19 Indonesia - EDA.ipynb` **You can view the notebook on https://colab.research.google.com/github/afrisiringo/Covid19Indonesia-EDAwithPython/blob/main/Covid19%20Indonesia%20-%20EDA.ipynb**
- Dependencies and required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`

## Note

There is a problem rendering the notebook on GitHub. As an alternative you can view the notebook in the Google Colab link provided

## Aspects Analyzed

- Data Time Range
- Monthly Trends of New Cases in Each Province
- Monthly Trends of New Cases in Each Island
- Monthly Trends of New Cases in Java Island
- Correlation Between COVID-19 Variables
- Geographic Analysis
- Comparison between Total Cases Population Density
- Province with the Highest Total COVID Cases on Each Island

## Workflow

- Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Perform data preprocessing tasks.
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the preprocessed data.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- DuckDB (for data analysis)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Seaborn (for data visualization)
